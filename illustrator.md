# So your designer sent you an illustrator file...
Here is how to export the graphical resources you need out of it.

Note: This applies for Adobe Illustrator CC 2014.0.0 release (which is actually v18.0.0)

1. open the file
2. find the graphical content that you want to export
3. Using the "Selection tool" (thats the basic arrow, hotkey "v") select the graphical content that you want to export
3. copy ut (cmd+c)
4. open a new document (cmd+n)
5. paste it (cmd+v)
6. Resize the artboard such that it only fits the graphical content that you need. Do this by using the "Artboard tool" (shift-O) and doubleclick on your content
7. Go to File->Save For Web (shift-alt-cmd-s)
8. In the top right corner of the window you can specify the file format. e g. PNG-24. Remember to also specify transparency etc.
9. Hit save and you are done :)
